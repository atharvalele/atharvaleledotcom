Hi, I'm Atharva, an embedded systems engineer who loves tinkering with electronics, taking deep dives into low-level code, and getting a greater understanding of the things I use every day. I'm also a fan of craft coffee, nature photography, and self-improvement.

In other words, I'm a curious engineer with a passion for learning and creating. I love taking things apart and figuring out how they work, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle. I'm also a big believer in lifelong learning and personal growth.

I'm excited to meet other people who share my interests, and I'm always happy to chat about tech, coffee, photography, or anything else that's on my mind.
